Programming bonus questions from an application for a technical, Software Engineering/Data Science position.

## [Roman Numerals to Arabic Numbers](./roman_to_arabic.py)
1) Given a string representing a Roman numeral, write a function to compute the Arabic numerical equivalent. For example,
```python
roman_to_arabic("MDCCLXXVI")
```
should return
```python
1776.
```

## [Farmer Optimization](./farmer_optimize.py)
2) Write a generic function to compute various scenarios for the following optimization problem: A farmer owns X acres of land. She profits P1 dollars per acre of corn and P2 dollars per acre of oats. Her team has Y hours of labor available. The corn takes H1 hours of labor per acre and oats require H2 hours of labor per acre. How many acres of each can be planted to maximize profits?  
Test the function for the following cases:  
a) X = 240, Y = 320, P1 = $40, P2 = $30, H1 = 2, H2 = 1  
b) X = 300, Y = 380, P1 = $70, P2 = $45, H1 = 3, H2 = 1  
c) X = 180, Y = 420, P1 = $65, P2 = $55, H1 = 3, H2 = 2
